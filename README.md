## 📁 Folder Structure

Each week’s learning is stored in its own folder like this:
Weekly-Learnings-CP/ │ ├── WEEK-1/ │ ├── topic_1.cpp │ ├── topic_2.cpp │ ├── input.txt │ └── output.txt │ ├── WEEK-2/ │ ├── another_topic.cpp │ └── notes.txt │ └── upload.sh


Each week's folder contains:
- ✅ Practical code implementations
- ✅ Hands-on examples
- ✅ My own notes and learnings

---

## 🔄 Automation

This repository uses a bash script (`upload.sh`) that:
- Detects and adds new weekly folders or files
- Automatically commits and pushes changes
- Adds a `.gitkeep` in empty folders to keep them tracked

```bash


📌 Goals
